The Bomb Detection and Diffusion Bot project aims to provide a safer alternative to soldiers and police officers by deploying a robot equipped with bomb detection and diffusion capabilities. Recognizing the scarcity of bomb-sniffing dogs and the risks associated with human intervention, the project proposes a manually driven robot that allows skilled professionals to utilize their expertise from a safe distance. Leveraging the Cybot platform and a custom graphical user interface (GUI), the bot will employ boundary and collision detection mechanisms, audio cues, and sensor data interpretation to navigate environments and identify potential threats. With objectives encompassing the integration of various Cybot features such as interrupts, WiFi-UART, ADC conversion, input capture, and pulse wave generation, the project seeks to develop a comprehensive solution for military and police applications, ultimately enhancing safety and minimizing risks in bomb detection and diffusion operations.
